## Feature to be implimented
### -Wanted to create a leaderboard that keeps track of peoples data in restdb
### -The quiz side was not well implimented and could have been so much more intricate.
### -The register and login page is also incomplete unable to store data. 

## Usage
-[JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/)
    - Animations from lottiefiles are used to give a better user experience on the website as well as a visual form of explanation for the educational contents on the homepage.
## testing
### Some features are not well implimented such as the header for just the index page it would create a border upon clicking and no other page has that issue.
### The map had alot of features but they were not well documneted thus alot of testing was done to ensure that the map displayed what it needed to.
### The api was fairly easy but i had to figure out ways to impliment proper validation
### THe hardest part of the assignment was testing the quiz as the quiz didnt save data the way i wanted it to and alot of effort was put in to link the data together.
